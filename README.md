|  student code | Represents the GUI clas |  
| client | Represents the server | 
| TestDiGraph | returns the current version of this graph, Mode Count - for testing changes in the graph | 
| TestGraphAlgo | Adds an edge to the graph  | 
| def add_node(self, node_id: int, pos: tuple = None)  |   Adds a node to the graph  |  
| def remove_node(self, node_id: int) |   Removes a node from the graph  | 
| def remove_edge(self, node_id1: int, node_id2: int)|  Removes an edge from the graph   |  

## HOW TO RUN THE GAME:
